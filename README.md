# Pick and Place using a 4DoF Robotic Manipulator
 

# Problem Statement
Create a 3-Dof/4-Dof robotic arm with a gripper from scratch and implement pick and place using MoveIt for a cube container. Assume all the required dimensions and details of the links and cube appropriately

# Assumptions 
Base: 
Diameter = 800 mm
Thickness = 200 mm

Link_1:
Length = 800 mm 
Width = 400 mm
Thickness = 200 mm

Link_2:
Length = 900 mm 
Width = 300 mm
Thickness = 200 mm

Link_3:
Length = 750 mm 
Width = 250 mm
Thickness = 200 mm

Vacuum Gripper:
Outer Radius = 200 mm
Inner Radius = 100 mm
